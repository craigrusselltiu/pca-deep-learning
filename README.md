# Improving Methods of Classifying Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks and AutoAugment
My thesis project aimed at improving current means in classifying prostate cancer aggressiveness by exploring the effectiveness of  3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) combined with AutoAugment. Two models were trained for this study, with one using randomly augmented images, and another using the best augmentation ‘policies’ obtained from AutoAugment. A policy consists of two contiguous image augmentations, detailed with the magnitude and probability in applying each.

## What I Learned
- Machine learning libraries including Keras and Tensorflow
- Using said libraries to implement originally devised models from scratch
- Reading and manipulating CSV files for specific functionalities
- Researching, designing, executing, and recording experiment results on machine learning models
- Among other things!
